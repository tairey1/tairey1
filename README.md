#### Greetings and Salutations, I’m @tairey1

#### I’m a Front-End Engineer interested in working with complex, client based user interfaces using the latest web development frameworks.

The framework that I am most experienced using is React.js, but I have worked with Angular and as Vue.js as well.
My most recent code examples and projects can be found under the /PersonalProjects Repository.
